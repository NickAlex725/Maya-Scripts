How to use my Final Touch Up tool:

The first row gives you the option to add a prefix or suffix to multiple objects at once
Fill in the box with what you want to add, then select weather you want this to be a prefix or suffix with the radial buttons, and then click Apply. This also works on naming groups.

the next row lets you create groups of objects and name it much faster than the traditinal way
Type in the name of the group and then click the Create Group button

The next row gives you 3 buttons. Freeze transformations, delete history by type, and auto UV.

The last row gives you options to set up a playblast.
You set the framerate of the playblast, its length, and weather you wireframe on shaded on.
Clicking Playblast will bring up the playblast options box so can select the file type and where you want to save it.
